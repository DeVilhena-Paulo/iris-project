<li>10:00-10:30: Noam Zilberstein (Cornell University)</a>: Outcome Separation Logic
<a href="#NoamZilberstein" data-bs-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
<div id="NoamZilberstein" class="collapse"><div class="abstract">Outcome Separation Logic is a new program logic for reasoning about both program correctness and incorrectness with computation effects such as nondeterminism and randomization. In this talk, I will outline the challenges of incorrectness reasoning and, in particular, how incorrectness interacts with effects. I will also talk about how some of the ideas behind OSL could be combined with Iris.</div></div>

<li>12:00-12:30: Arthur Chargu√©raud (Inria)</a>: Towards pushing CFML features into Iris
<a href="#ArthurCharguraud" data-bs-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
<div id="ArthurCharguraud" class="collapse"><div class="abstract">CFML embeds in Coq a simple Separation Logic for ML-style programs. It is designed for establishing total correctness proofs for sequential programs. CFML leverages two techniques, namely "characteristic formulae" and "lifting", to enable reasoning about ML program values using directly their Coq counterpart. CFML's approach greatly reduces the noise in proofs, especially for programs exploiting algebraic data structures and pattern matching. CFML has been shown in practice to scale up to the verification of nontrivial sequential algorithms and data structures. The purpose of this talk is to advertise the features of CFML that Iris could benefit from, and discuss the technical challenges involved. Details may be found in my habilitation manuscript: https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2023/hdr/chargueraud-hdr.pdf</div></div>
