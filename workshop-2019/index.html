    Compositional Non-Interference for Fine-Grained Concurrent Programs
    <a href="#dan" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
    <div id="dan" class="collapse abstract">
    We present SeLoC: a relational separation logic for verifying non-interference of fine-grained concurrent programs in a compositional way. SeLoC is more expressive than previous approaches, both in terms of the features of the target programming language, and in terms of the logic. The target programming language supports dynamically allocated references (pointers), higher-order functions, and fine-grained fork-based concurrency with low-level atomic operators like compare-and-set. The logic provides an invariant mechanism to establish protocols on data that is not protected by locks. This allows us to verify programs that were beyond the reach of previous approaches.<br> 

A key technical innovation in SeLoC is a relational version of weakest preconditions to track information flow using separation logic resources. On top of these weakest preconditions we build a type system-like abstraction, using invariants and logical relations. SeLoC has been mechanized on top of the Iris framework in the Coq proof assistant.

    Specifying I/O using Abstract Nested Hoare Triples
    <a href="#bart" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
    <div id="bart" class="abstract collapse">
    We propose a separation logic-based approach for modular specification and verification of the I/O behavior of a program. The approach uses higher-order separation logic predicates to express "abstract nested Hoare triples" that abstractly associate a precondition and a postcondition with an I/O action. The approach supports verifying higher-level I/O actions built on top of lower-level ones, as well as "virtual I/O" actions that in fact just manipulate memory.

    Playing spy games in Iris
    <a href="#francois" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
    <div id="francois" class="abstract collapse">
    I will discuss the specification and proof in Iris of a "local generic solver",
    that is, an on-demand, incremental, memoizing least fixed point computation
    algorithm. Although the solver uses long-lived mutable internal state for
    several purposes, including memoization and "spying", it is apparently pure: no
    side effects are mentioned in its specification. The proof uses prophecy
    variables, which it exploits both directly and in the proof of a restricted
    infinitary conjunction rule. This is joint work with Paulo Emílio de Vilhena and
    Jacques-Henri Jourdan.

  <p>In addition to the invited talks, there will be the following contributed talks:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/">Andrew Appel (Princeton, USA):</a> Recent developments in the Verified Software Toolchain</li>
  <li><a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~haidang/">Hai Dang (MPI-SWS, Germany):</a> RustBelt Relaxed
  <a href="#hai" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
  <div id="hai" class="abstract collapse">
  The original RustBelt made the significant simplifying assumption that the language is sequentially consistent. We adapt RustBelt to account for the relaxed-memory operations that concurrent Rust libraries actually use, in the process uncovering a data race in the Arc library. We will focus the discussion on how to reason about resource reclamation under relaxed memory, using variants of cancellable invariants that are improved with a logical construction we call synchronized ghost state.

  <a href="#armael" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
  <div id="armael" class="abstract collapse">
  In this talk, I will present the analysis of a state-of-the-art incremental cycle detection algorithm due to Bender, Fineman, Gilbert, and Tarjan. The algorithm maintains subtle invariants, and features a non trivial asymptotic, amortized complexity bound. I will detail how we exploit Separation Logic with Time Credits to simultaneously verify the correctness and the worst-case amortized complexity of the modified algorithm.

  This is joint work with Arthur Charguéraud, Jacques-Henri Jourdan and François Pottier.

  <li><a href="http://itu.dk/people/jkas/">Jonas Kastberg Hinrichsen (ITU, Denmark):</a> Actris: Session-Type Based Reasoning in Separation Logic
  <a href="#jonas" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
  <div id="jonas" class="abstract collapse">
  Message passing is a useful abstraction to implement concurrent programs. For real-world systems, however, it is often combined with other programming and concurrency paradigms, such as higher-order functions, mutable state, shared-memory concurrency, and locks. We present Actris: a logic for proving functional correctness of programs that use a combination of the aforementioned features. Actris combines the power of modern concurrent separation logics with a first-class protocol mechanism—based on session types—for reasoning about message passing in the presence of other concurrency paradigms.
We show that Actris provides a suitable level of abstraction by proving functional correctness of a variety of examples, including a distributed merge sort, a distributed load-balancing mapper, and a variant of the map-reduce model, using relatively simple specifications. Soundness of Actris is shown using a continuation-passing style (CPS) interpretation of its protocol mechanism into the Iris framework. We mechanised the theory of Actris, together with tactics for symbolic
execution of programs, as well as all examples in the paper, in the Coq proof assistant.

  <li><a href="https://lepigre.fr/">Rodolphe Lepigre (MPI-SWS, Germany):</a> Extending Iris with Prophecy Variables
  <a href="#rodolphe" data-toggle="collapse">[abstract]</a>
  <div id="rodolphe" class="abstract collapse">
  In this talk, I will present a recent addition to the Iris framework: prophecy variables. Prophecy variables can be used to predict what will happen later in the execution of a program, while reasoning about its current state. They were first introduced by Abadi and Lamport in the nineties, but were never formally integrated into a Hoare-style program logic before. Thanks to the addiction of prophecy variables we are now able to verify logical atomicity  (a relative of linearizability that will be presented by Ralf) for concurrent data structures like RDCSS or the Herlihy-Wing queue in Iris. These data structures are tricky because the linearization points of their operations (i.e.,  the precise point in their execution at which they appear to take effect) can sometimes only be identified after the fact (it may depend on future events). And as we will see that is the kind of situation where prophecy variables can help.

  This is joint work with Ralf Jung,  Gaurav Parthasarathy,  Marianna Rapoport, Amin Timany, Derek Dreyer and Bart Jacobs.

  <p>With approximately 300.000 inhabitants, Aarhus is the second largest city in Denmark. It was founded by the Vikings in the 8th century, and is located in a natural bay along a small river and surrounded by forests. Aarhus is often referred to as "the youngest and brightest city in Denmark” because of its large student population, almost 1/5 of the residents are students. The young population and the fact that the city is the unofficial "capital of west Denmark" means that Aarhus has a large concentration of attractions, shopping and city life.</p> 

  What to see and do in Aarhus:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.aros.dk/">ARoS Aarhus Art Museum.</a> One of the biggest museums in the northern part of Europe. Enjoy the permanent and temporary exhibitions or take a walk in Your Rainbow Panorama with a scenic view of the city.<br> Address: Aros Allé 2, 8000 Aarhus C. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.dengamleby.dk/">The Old Town.</a> A Danish Open Air Museum / The Old Town ("Den Gamle By") was founded in 1909 as the world's first open-air museum of urban history and culture. Take a tour in the city as it looked from the 16th century and forward.<br> Address: Viborgvej 2, 8000 Aarhus C.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.visitaarhus.com/ln-int/tropical-houses-botanical-garden-gdk653428">Tropical Houses at the Botanical Garden.</a> The Greenhouses will give you an educational and sensuous experience strolling through the beautiful and varied sceneries, and you will find plants from most parts of the world. There is a free admission to the Greenhouses and the café serves great food at fair prices.<br> Address: Møllevejen 10, 8000 Aarhus C.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dokk1.dk/english">DOKK1.</a> The city's new impressive library which is located at the waterfront in the city center. Here you will find much more than just books.
  <li>Harbors, forests and beaches. If the weather behaves, Aarhus also has a lot of outdoor attractions/activities. They obviously include strolling the harbors, forests and beaches on both the north and south side of the city. On the south side of the city close to the Queens summer residence Marselisborg you will find <a href="http://kongehuset.dk/slotte-og-kongeskibet/marselisborg-slot">Marselisborg Habor</a> with nice restaurants and the Marselisborg forest extending along the ocean and beaches.</li>
