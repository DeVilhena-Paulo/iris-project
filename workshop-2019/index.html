  <h2><a name="about-aarhuss"></a>About Aarhus</h2>
  <hr>
  <img src="aros.jpg" alt="ARoS" style="width: 350px; float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <p>With approximately 300.000 inhabitants, Aarhus is the second largest city in Denmark. It was founded by the Vikings in the 8th century, and is located in a natural bay along a small river and surrounded by forests. Aarhus is often referred to as "the youngest and brightest city in Denmark” because of its large student population, almost 1/5 of the residents are students. The young population and the fact that the city is the unofficial "capital of west Denmark" means that Aarhus has a large concentration of attractions, shopping and city life.</p> 

  What to see and do in Aarhus:
  <ul>
